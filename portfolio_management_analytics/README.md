# Portfolio Management Analytics

## script and slides from APRA Chapters Share the Knowledge (2/19/16)

The slides are included as well as R script to run the code.

I will try to make a slimmed down version as well as provide a sample data set for practicing at some point in the near future.

I will also add in a RMarkdown document that you can pull for an individual gift officer.  It is like a ready-made report that can be created with a click of a button.

Let me know if you have any questions or anything isn't working.
