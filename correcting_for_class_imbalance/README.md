# Fork This Script Friday (#4)

## Correcting for Class Imbalance

Correcting for Class Imbalance is an issue that has been mentioned a few times on the DMM.

It is definitely prevalent in our sector so hopefully this is relevant, helpful and prompts a good discussion on tactics.

As always, a very simple script is provided for stealing and editing.  Otherwise, suggestions for other tactics are welcome on the DMM.

As far as specific ideas.  I mention a few in the script.

1. Is there a better way to iterate over a data set as suggested in this solution?
2. Why are there duplicate IDs in my final file?
3. What other features should we include? (if we want to get off-topic a little and just discuss building a planned giving model)
4. How are you dealing with class imbalance?


Any other ideas? Steal this script or maybe just share what you are doing with class imbalance on the DMM
