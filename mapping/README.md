# Fork This Script Friday (#2)

## Mapping Data

This is a simple starter script for mapping constituent data in R.

For this example, I changed all the addresses to random business or organization addresses so that I wouldn't be giving away the address of any individuals.

Otherwise, the data relates to individuals in a wealthy area above a certain wealth capacity rating threshold.

One idea that I have for mapping is to look in an area and find our close friends and then see if there is any one that lives near them that has capacity in the hopes that they may know them and could help open doors.

This is a simple script that maps out constituents and applies a few variables as visual elements.  

Further, a promising area can be highlighted and a subset of the data containing these prospects can be created and exported.

I don't even know that R is the best tool for mapping but I have seen the topic pop up on the DMM a few times.  This script will work.

Unlike last time, I don't necessarily have a list of questions but a few thoughts:

1. Can this look any nicer?
2. Is there a way to make this interactive/dynamic? (I've seen GIFs created I believe or a Shiny app perhaps)
3. Someone could add some code that provides driving directions between points (I believe it is easy to do with ggmap, I just haven't played around with it yet)


Any other ideas? Steal this script or maybe just share what you are doing with maps on the DMM
